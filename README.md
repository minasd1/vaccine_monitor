# vaccine_monitor
Given a dataset that consists of citizen records, this application is used to store the dataset appropriately and answer many different queries regarding the vaccine status of citizens. To do so, a wide variety of data structures are used (a hashtable, bloomfilters, skiplists, a binary search tree  and simply linked list).

The dataset may have citizen records that are from many different countries, and let us be informed for their vaccination status with regard to many different viruses. Examples of implementation and expected results will soon be given
